# Traineeship Documentation Plan <a name="TDP"></a>

## Tentative Planning
- Which tasks to perform during traineeship (brief)
- When are tasks planned to be performed
- Look into DELPHI the Disqover data platform that serves as AelinTx's one stop shop for data on research & development activities.

## Data Management
- How and where will data be stored and structured? (FAIR)

## Traceability of Steps and Methods
This git repository markdown page will be used to document the project steps in a traceable manner.

## Version Control of Code

The code will be stored in [this private git repository](https://github.com/TVR-AelinTX/traineeship). 
Access will be given to the internal and external traineeship coordinators before the start of the traineeship. 
Links to scripts pertaining to tasks and subtasks of the traineeship will be provided in the ETN and can be accessed by the authorized coordinators.
